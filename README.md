## Project Structure

This `README.md` gives an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to build and deploy the application.

## Features

**SOAP & REST Web Service**: Exposes a `sendMail(String emailAddress,String emailSubject,String emailMessage,String emailFiles)` method to post mail with or without attachment(s).

## Getting Started

![Project Codes & Tasks](/src/main/webapp/assets/img/code.jpg "Project Codes and Task")

---

### Prerequisites

>- **Apache TomEE 10**: is the application server used during development, but any Jakarta EE 10-compliant server should work.
>- **Java 23**: Ensure you have Java 23 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.
- **JAX-WS**: For SOAP web service implementation.

### Building and Running the Application

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/postmaster.git
    cd spectre
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server.

4. **Start your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server**:

   Start server and access the application:

    - SOAP Service: WSDL at `http://localhost:8081/postmaster/ws/sendemail?wsdl`
    - REST Service: http://localhost:8081/postmaster/api/sendemail
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8081/postmaster/index.jsp`

## Detailed Explanation of Components

### 1. **SOAP Web Service** (JAX-WS)

The SOAP web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.postmaster.api.soap.PostmasterSOAP.java`.

Example sendMail SOAP Request:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:mail="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws">
    <soap:Header/>
    <soap:Body>
        <mail:sendEmail>
            <emailAddress>someone@somebody.com</emailAddress>
            <emailSubject>Test Email from PostMan</emailSubject>
            <emailMessage>Hello I am a test email message from Postman Application</emailMessage>
            <emailFiles />
        </mail:sendEmail>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
Example sendMail SOAP Response:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
    <soap:Body>
        <mail:sendEmailResponse xmlns:mail="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws">
            <Status>Message sent successfully</Status>
        </mail:sendEmailResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### 2. **REST Web Service** (JAX-RS)

The REST web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.postmaster.api.rest.PostmasterREST.java`.

Example sendMail REST Request:
```json
    {
      "emailAddress": "someone@somebody.com",
      "emailSubject": "Test Email from PostMan",
      "emailMessage": "Hello I am a test email message from Postman Application",
      "emailFiles": ""
    }

```
Example sendMail REST Response:
```json
    {
      "Status": "Message sent successfully"
    }
```
